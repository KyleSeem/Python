2. In the__init__(), allow the user to specify the following attributes:
    * price
    * speed
    * fuel
    * mileage
    * tax (if the price is greater than 10,000, set the tax to be 15%. Otherwise, set the tax to be 12%)

3. Create six different instances of the class Car

4. In the class have a method called display_all() that returns all the information about the car as a string.
